# ConViT
This respository aims to predict the porous media permeability from 2D porous media image using ConVIT modelã€‚
## data
The datasets include two parts. The first one is a synthetic 2D image dataset used for test validation. The second dataset contains 200 real sandstone 2D images scanned by CT. Due to upload restrictions, if you need more dataset images, please contact me via email at 1912213971@qq.com.
## model
It includes the construction of the dataset, the building of the ConViT model, the construction of several comparative models, and the training and testing process of the models. Additionally, it involves the application of Grad-CAM for visualization and interpretation of the model's decision-making process.
